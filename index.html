    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Date of Last Revision: June 21, 2025</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Five Second QA ("We", "Us", or "Our"). It governs the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information gathered through Five Second QA's websites ("Sites") and mobile applications ("Apps"). Your use of our Sites or Apps constitutes acceptance of this policy.</p>

    <h2>DATA COLLECTION</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not collect any personal data</strong>. However, we utilize third-party services that collect <strong>non‑personal anonymous data</strong> to monitor and improve app performance and usability.</p>

    <h3>Firebase Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> collects anonymized usage data (e.g., session duration, event interactions). IP addresses are anonymized by default :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> collects anonymous crash reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Remote Config:</strong> allows us to remotely adjust app behavior without an update.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All Firebase data is encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and, for most services, also at rest :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Access to data is strictly controlled and logged :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</p>

    <h3>RevenueCat</h3>
    <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and purchases. It collects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purchase history:</strong> details of initial purchases and renewals, required to ensure entitlements and receipts.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous app‑specific user ID:</strong> generated by RevenueCat; not linked to personal identity unless you explicitly set a user ID :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Collected data does <strong>not</strong> include personal identifiers, contact details, or sensitive information. All data is encrypted in transit :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.</p>

    <h2>HOW WE USE DATA</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve app stability and user experience.</li>
      <li>Detect and fix crashes.</li>
      <li>Manage and verify subscription access.</li>
      <li>Update app behavior remotely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MOBILE APPS</h2>
    <p>Our apps are distributed via third-party app stores, which may collect device/account metadata. We do not collect location data, contact lists, or personal identifiers beyond the anonymous IDs used by Firebase and RevenueCat. Push notifications are solely opt‑in and used for app‑related updates.</p>

    <h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

    <h2>DO NOT TRACK</h2>
    <p>We do not collect data for behavioral advertising and do not respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>

    <h2>THIRD‑PARTY LINKS</h2>
    <p>Our Sites/Apps may link to external services; their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect data, but complete security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>CHANGES & QUESTIONS</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of our Sites or Apps indicates acceptance of any changes.</p>
