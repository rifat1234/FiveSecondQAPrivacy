    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Date of Last Revision: June 21, 2025</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Five Second QA ("We", "Us", or "Our"). It governs the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information gathered through Five Second QA's websites ("Sites") and mobile applications ("Apps"). Your use of our Sites or Apps constitutes acceptance of this policy.</p>

    <h2>DATA COLLECTION</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not collect any personal data</strong>. However, we use third-party services that collect <strong>non‑personal anonymous data</strong> to improve usability and performance.</p>

    <h3>Firebase Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> collects anonymized usage data (e.g., session length, feature interactions) to help us improve app performance and user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Crashlytics:</strong> gathers anonymous crash reports to identify and fix app crashes.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote Config:</strong> fetches remote configuration parameters to customize app behavior without requiring an update.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All Firebase data is anonymous, does not include personal identifiers, and complies with Google’s privacy standards :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</p>

    <h3>RevenueCat</h3>
    <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscription and purchase data. It collects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchase history (initial purchases, renewals)—required to verify and manage subscriptions.</li>
      <li>An anonymous app‑specific user ID (not linked to your identity).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal or contact information is collected. Data is encrypted in transit and stored on secure servers :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.</p>

    <h2>HOW WE USE DATA</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance app functionality and user experience.</li>
      <li>Monitor stability and fix crashes.</li>
      <li>Manage and verify subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Configure app behavior via remote settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MOBILE APPS</h2>
    <p>Apps are distributed through third-party stores. We do not collect location data, address book info, or identifiers beyond the anonymous IDs used by Firebase and RevenueCat. Push notifications are opt‑in and used only for app-related messaging.</p>

    <h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

    <h2>DO NOT TRACK</h2>
    <p>We do not engage in behavioral advertising, and we do not respond to Do Not Track browser signals.</p>

    <h2>THIRD‑PARTY LINKS</h2>
    <p>We may link to third-party services; their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect data, but cannot guarantee complete security.</p>

    <h2>CHANGES & QUESTIONS</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of our Sites or Apps indicates acceptance of changes.</p>
